Hi, I'm a bit worn 👒 No, seriously, just call me <b>robi</b>. This is my personal blog to share all the interesting stuff! Is't going to be a mix of programming, linux, electronics, hacking ☠ and whatever I find interesting 🍻<br /><br />

Did you find something you like here? Did you know that I really like <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/robi24">utterances</a>? 😁 ☕ <br /><br />

You can find me on <a href="https://github.com/robi24">github</a> and reach via <a href="mailto:robi@bitwornhat.com>">email</a>.
