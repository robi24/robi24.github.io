Hi, I'm a bit worn 👒 No, seriously, just call me **robi**. This is my personal blog to share all the interesting stuff! Is't going to be a mix of programming, linux, electronics, hacking ☠ and whatever I find interesting 🍻

Did you find something you like here? Did you know that I really like [coffee][coffee-link]? 😁 ☕  

You can find me on [github][github-link] and reach me via <robi@bitwornhat.com>
